		<h2>Shanara Watts</h2>
		<p>I am 20 years old. My major is Information Technology
		and I am currently in my third year. I am interested in Web
		Development because everyday people around the world are 
		finding ways to make money on the internet and most of the 
		times through website or social media. Therefore being able 
		to contibute to this by developing and designing webpages 
		sounds like an income and good thing to me.</p>
